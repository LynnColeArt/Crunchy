# Claude Contexts

If you write code with Claude or ChatGPT 1o, the system's going to need some context!

This section includes
* A summary of the project
* A roadmap
* Philosophy character and design guidelines.

These files should give the system the base prompting it needs to write workable code.

All you have to do is keep your chatbot on topic!

Models that should be okay to work with:

* Claude 3.0 and 3.5 
* ChatGTP 1o and 1o mini

For best results, stack models for QA... and pray.
