# Music-to-Code Transpiler: Project Crunchy

## Summary

I’m working on a new music-to-code system called **Crunchy**, a two-way transpiler that converts **sheet music into logical code** and back again. The goal is to unlock smarter, dynamic music notation and enable AI systems to **reason through music orchestration**—something current systems can’t do.

## Key Methodology Points

### 1. Dataset Preparation
- Use the **MuseScore corpus** and other **public domain/Creative Commons datasets** (roughly 400,000 compositions) as the foundation.
- Add my own discography to inject **novel, experimental structures** early in the process.

### 2. Edge Case Handling
- Normalize, clean, and split the **Suno corpus** to treat it as an **edge-case dataset**.
- Compare Suno outputs to organic compositions to identify patterns, anomalies, and “weird” structures unique to AI-generated music.

### 3. Transparent Process
- Develop an **objective, peer-reviewable methodology** for analyzing the Suno corpus.
- Actively invite feedback to address any unconscious bias in the process.
- Share transformed Suno compositions as code back to the creators, respecting consent and ensuring transparency.

### 4. Tools and Technical Focus
- Design a syntax that blends **JavaScript and Python** with support for **logical structures** and **regex patterns**.
- Use **C++** with Flex and Bison to build a **compiler** that optimizes, transforms, and cross-compiles music notation.

## Results I Hope to Achieve

### 1. A Two-Way Music Transpiler
- Accurately convert **sheet music into logic-based code** and back into clean, reliable notation.

### 2. Smarter Music Representation
Introduce **logic blocks** for music, enabling dynamic features like:
- Adaptive orchestration (e.g., live vs. studio performance).
- Genre shifts, loops, improvisations, and distortions.

### 3. AI Training and Reasoning
- Represent music as code to train systems that can **reason** through orchestration, harmony, and improvisation.

### 4. Objective Suno Corpus Analysis
- Develop a **fair, repeatable methodology** for analyzing Suno data.
- Study the Suno corpus to understand its structures and evaluate Crunchy’s performance against AI-generated outputs.

### 5. Transparency and Respect for Artists
- Share transformations back to Suno creators while ensuring no data is retained without explicit consent.

## Big Picture Impact

This project will:
- **Revolutionize music notation** by treating music as programmable logic.
- Enable new tools for **composers and musicians** to save time and unlock dynamic possibilities.
- Lay the groundwork for **AI systems** that understand, reason through, and adapt music intelligently.

## Project Roadmap

This is a **multi-phase project**, and I’ll be sharing the process and learnings along the way.

**Stay tuned for updates!**
