## Error Handling Approach

### Core Philosophy
Our error handling system prioritizes clear communication in musical terms over technical details. The goal is to help users understand and fix issues without needing to understand the underlying technical implementation.

### Error Categories

1. **Structural Errors**
```
Example:
"Measure structure issue in Bar 23:
- Missing time signature after tempo change
- Each measure needs a clear time signature when tempo changes
Suggestion: Add time signature at the start of measure 23"
```

2. **Track Relationship Errors**
```
Example:
"Track synchronization issue:
- Violin part: 45 measures
- Piano part: 43 measures
Action needed: Align all parts to the same length (currently mismatched by 2 measures)"
```

3. **Notation Errors**
```
Example:
"Invalid notation in measure 15, Cello part:
- Found quarter note triplet spanning barline
- Triplets must be contained within a single measure
Suggestion: Split the triplet at the barline"
```

4. **Format Conversion Issues**
```
Example:
"Cannot convert glissando marking in measure 27:
- MusicXML supports this notation
- MIDI format does not support glissando markings
Note: This marking will be preserved if converting back to MusicXML"
```

### Error Handling Strategy

1. **Detection Level**
- Parser level (format-specific issues)
- Internal representation level (structural issues)
- Converter level (format compatibility issues)

2. **Error Response**
```python
# Example error object structure
error_info = {
    "location": {
        "measure": 23,
        "beat": 2,
        "part": "Violin I"
    },
    "issue": "Invalid rhythm division",
    "context": "5/4 time signature cannot be divided into 6 equal parts",
    "suggestion": "Consider using triplets or adjusting note values"
}
```

3. **Recovery Options**
- Continue with warnings when safe
- Partial conversion with clear marking of issues
- Full stop only when musical integrity would be compromised

### Implementation Guidelines

1. **Message Construction**
```
Each error message should include:
- Location in the score
- Clear description of the issue
- Musical context
- Suggested resolution when possible
```

2. **User Communication**
```
Priority order for information:
1. What happened (in musical terms)
2. Where it happened (in the score)
3. Why it matters
4. How to fix it
```

3. **Logging Levels**
```
ERROR: Issues that prevent correct conversion
WARNING: Issues that may affect musical interpretation
INFO: Notable conversion decisions
DEBUG: Technical details (hidden by default)
```

### Example Scenarios

1. **Multi-Track Timing Issue**
```
"Track timing mismatch detected:
Location: Measure 45
Issue: Piano and Violin parts are misaligned by one beat
Suggestion: Check for extra rest in Piano part"
```

2. **Notation Conversion Limitation**
```
"Format limitation encountered:
- Measure 12: Complex articulation mark
- Converting from MuseScore to MIDI
- MIDI cannot represent this articulation
Note: Articulation will be preserved if converting back to MuseScore"
```

3. **Structure Validation**
```
"Score structure issue:
- Final measure (bar 64) is incomplete
- Current length: 2 beats
- Expected: 4 beats in 4/4 time
Suggestion: Add completing rests or check for missing notes"
```

### Benefits of This Approach

1. **User-Friendly**
- Clear, non-technical language
- Musical context preservation
- Actionable suggestions

2. **Maintainable**
- Structured error information
- Consistent message formatting
- Clear error categorization

3. **Extensible**
- Easy to add new error types
- Format-specific detail support
- Multiple detail levels available

This approach ensures that error handling serves both technical accuracy and user understanding, making the tool accessible to both developers and musicians.
